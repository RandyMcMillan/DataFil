The library provided here consists of two main components. 

First, the filter algorithms, which can all be found in the Filters group of the project. Note that these filters are compatible with all iOS and Mac OS devices, including the Apple Watch and can be used in isolation from the rest of the project. 

Second is the supporting code that can be used to aid the use of sensor data in your application. All of these classes can be found in the `globalModel` group of the project. These are classes that have been specifically designed to run on iOS and Watch OS devices, and include features such as a communication stack for streaming sensor data from an Apple Watch and a class for comprehensive sensor management. These are discussed further in the following sections.
