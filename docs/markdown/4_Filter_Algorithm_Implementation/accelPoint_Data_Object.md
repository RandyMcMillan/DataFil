An `accelPoint` object represents an instantaneous sensor reading, with X Y and Z values. Distinct points should be given unique IDs. This ID may be for example a sequence number or a timestamp of the reading. Initialisation using the default initialiser will set all values, including ID to 0. accelPoints are used as the data model input and output for the filter algorithms, and is designed to be similar in function to Appleâ€™s implementation.

# Function Summary

### get$Axis

`func getAccelAxis(axis: String) -> Double`

`func getGyroAxis(axis: String) -> Double`

`func getMagAxis(axis: String) -> Double`

Utility function used to allow data access to be configured by a string, in a similar fashion to the parameter stinging functionality provided in accelPoint. Allows for runtime changes to the axis of data that is being filtered or accessed.
