**Welcome to the Wiki for this project.**

A convenient and reliable set of signal processing tools for developers to integrate into their project to better utilise the sensors on an iPhone.

Creating a filter that has the right characteristics can be an extremely time consuming task, and often requires knowledge of signal processing.

This library provides an alternative to that, with ready to use filters that can be customised and integrated into your application quickly and easily.

Key features include:

* A consistent, easy to use interface and simple data model
* “Drag and drop” functionality. Each filter can operate as a standalone class. No project imports or external dependencies required.
* The latest Swift 3 syntax.
* Concurrent calculations where necessary.
